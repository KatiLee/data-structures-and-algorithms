# Code Challenge 17: Breadth First Traversal
Write a function called breadth first
Arguments: tree
Return: list of all values in the tree, in the order they were encountered

## Whiteboard Process

## Approach & Efficiency
The breadthFirst function visits each node in the tree level by level, starting from the root node and moving to its children. It uses a queue data structure to keep track of the nodes to be processed, ensuring that each node is visited exactly once.

## Solution
It doesn't quite work with the tests yet, but we ran out of time.
