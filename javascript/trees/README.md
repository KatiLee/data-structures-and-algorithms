# Code Challenge 16: Find Max Value
Find the largest number in a binary tree.

## Whiteboard Process
[Code Challenge 16 Whiteboard](/trees/whiteboard-16.png)

## Approach & Efficiency
To solve this, I needed to add a new method called findMaximumValue to the existing code. This method should go through all the numbers in the tree and pick the largest one. It should then return that largest number.

BigO of time would be O(n), as it would depend on how many nodes there were to scan through
BigO of space would be O(h), similarly it would depend on how tall the tree is, so it would be based off height
